In a similar context,&nbsp;<strong>Livingston Alves McConaughey </strong>was born to his popular parents <strong>Matthew McConaughey</strong> (father) and <strong>Camila Alves </strong>(mother), with a silver spoon on his head.</p><p>The third-born child of American actor Matthew and Model, Camila was born in 2012 in the United States of America. As of 2020, his age is 7. Moreover, Livingston holds American citizenship and belongs to the mixed (American- Brazilian) ethnicity.</p><h2>Livingston's Parents- Matthew and Camila Got Hitched in 2012</h2><p>The Oscar Winner weds the American-Brazilian model, <a href=#><strong>Camila Alves</strong></a> on June 9, 2018, in a private Catholic ceremony. Similarly, they became engaged on the 25th of December &nbsp;2011.</p><p>The couple's daughters Levi and Vida were 4 and 2 at the time of the wedding who acted as ring bearer and flower girl. "Somehow they both seem to understand what we are doing on a spiritual level," the American-Brazilian model said to the <i>People</i> of the childrenâ€™s involvement.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/27/Wedding-Camila-Alves-and-Matthew-McConaughey-Image-People-Magazine2-1582780233424.jpg><p>Born on November 4, 1969, the producer wore three-piece black Dolce & Gabbana tuxedo whilst his bride looked dapper in a wedding gown.
