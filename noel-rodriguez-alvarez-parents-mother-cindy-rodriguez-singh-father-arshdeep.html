One month after the police issued an Amber warning, searches for Noel Rodriguez-Alvarez are still going on in the Texas hamlet of Everman.</strong></p><p>Everman police officials think the 6-year-old kid may have died away, despite the fact that they are still looking for his remains.</p><p>Noel Rodriguez-Alvarez is one of the ten children of stepfather Arshdeep Singh and mother Cindy Rodriguez-Singh. Noel Rodriguez-Alvarez has not been seen since the autumn of last year, although there have been reports of his disappearance since March 25.</p><p>Six of Cindy Rodriguez-Singh’s children and their stepfather, Arshdeep Singh, left for India on March 22.</p><p>Arshdeep Singh is now sought by police, according to the Fort-Worth Star-Telegram, a news website headquartered in Texas. He is accused of stealing $10,000 in cash from his place of work to pay for his journey to India.</p><p>In order to discover more about Noel Rodriguez Alvarez’s parents, let’s read the article through to the finish.</p><h2>Alvarez, Noel Rodriguez Parents: Arshdeep Singh, father, and Cindy Rodriguez Singh, mother</h2><p>Alvarez, Noel Rodriguez Cindy Rodriguez Singh, and her father, Arshdeep Singh, are her parents.</p><p>Along with their mother, Cindy Rodriguez-Singh, and stepfather, Arshdeep Singh, six of Rodriguez-Alvarez’s siblings fled to India, according to the police.</p><p>Noel Rodriguez-Alvarez’s mother, Cindy Rodriguez-Singh, said that her son was “possessed by a demon” and had no regard for the safety of her twin daughters.</p><p>Noel was regarded as a lovely, outgoing, and lovable youngster by a foster parent, despite his physical and developmental impairments from birth.</p><p>Sources claim that Noel disappeared in October 2022, just after Cindy gave birth to her twin children.</p><h2>Additional Information Regarding This Case</h2><p>Arshdeep withdrew $10,000 from AGHA Enterprises and transferred $8,000 into his personal bank account before departing the United States. He is seen making the deposit on security camera video from his bank.</p><p>Arshdeep Singh used his credit card to purchase the tickets, as per the officials. Arshdeep and his spouse Cindy are facing allegations of putting a child in danger or abandoning them, and subsequent to the theft’s discovery, Arshdeep was additionally charged with second-degree criminal theft.</p><p>Police have scoured more than 500 acres in an attempt to find the evidence that might point to Noel’s corpse.</p><p>The Fort-Worth Star Telegram reports that in order to find out whether Noel was buried under the concrete of Cindy and Arshdeep’s house, the police had already pulled it up. They believe him to be dead.</p><p>Cindy had lived in someone else’s home for 10 years, but Arshdeep had been living there for the last two years.</p><p>An elderly Everman resident named Charles Parsons owned the home in which they were living. Parsons was equally shocked to see that Arshdeep seemed like a kind man who cared for his children.</p><p>The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports that in March, Everman, Texas, police performed a welfare check at the family’s residence after receiving a complaint from Child Protective Services indicating that Noel was missing and that they “lived in squalor.” This discovery brought the matter to light.</p><p>When Cindy’s children were found sleeping in her vehicle some 10 years ago, the old guy persuaded her to move in. Cindy moved into Parsons’ home in this manner.</p><p>The FBI and Indian authorities are working together to extradite the two to the US.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":36992,"10":2,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/"}{"1":78}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Texas hamlet of Everman</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Who Is Theo Hayes Husband Stephen Hayes?
