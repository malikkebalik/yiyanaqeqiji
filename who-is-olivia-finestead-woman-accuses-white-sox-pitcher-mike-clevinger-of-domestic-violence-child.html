Now, he is under investigation by <a href=# rel>Major League Baseball</a>. The mother took to her Instagram to accuse the athlete of the wrongdoings and also shared images of her injuries. Finestead explains that she has been in touch with the MLB‚Äôs Department of Investigations since this summer.</p><p>The 24-year-old wrote, "You really deserve hell. I‚Äôve kept quiet for almost a year and you continue to covertly abuse your infant, withhold ALL of her belongings, we have none of our stuff, still not even her birth certificate or her car seat attachment. He‚Äôs made sure to do everything he can to keep control." She tells <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Athletic</a> that Clevinger slapped her in a hotel room when the Padres were playing the Dodgers in June 2022. She went on to call him a ‚Äú<a href=# rel>huge drug addict</a>,‚Äù addicted to using mushrooms and acid daily. Clevinger‚Äôs agent, Seth Levinson, also tells the outlet, "We need to fairly and thoroughly protect our client and at the same time be respectful of the White Sox and MLB. We need time before responding.‚Äù On the other side, The White Sox have claimed that they were not aware of these allegations against Clevinger when they rolled out a one-year, $12 million deal.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Who is Ms Hill?

She has also claimed that she is in touch with another woman Clevinger has reportedly assaulted. Finestead shared a screenshot of the message from one of them and claimed that he threatened the mother of his other children - daughters born in 2016 and 2017. She writes, "Mike, the star would be an apology to ALL of your kids and your kids‚Äô mothers. You‚Äôre doing the opposite by continuing what you‚Äôre doing behind lawyers, denying and lying. I gave you chances privately. You chose this."&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>'Absolutely abhorrent behavior'</h2><p>One user said, "I‚Äôm sadly not surprised just by his close association with Bauer. They prob have gotten away with this for longer than any of us realize. This is definitely unacceptable behavior to any woman and child." Another user tweeted, "Mike Clevinger cannot throw another pitch in MLB if the sport wants to remind its athletes that abuse towards women is a zero-tolerance policy." One more person said, "Of course #MikeClevinger is being investigated for abusing hisbwife and 3 kids. His appearance is the epitome of trailer park trash. #Padres were smart to not re-sign this Gomer-pile creep-stache."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I‚Äôm sadly not surprised just by his close association with Bauer.
