She is best known as an original cast member of the Bravo reality television series The Real Housewives of Orange County (RHOC), featuring in 14 of the 17 seasons since its 2006 premiere. She is also the founder and CEO of Coto Insurance and Financial Services, a company that provides life, health, and retirement planning services to thousands of clients. But how did Vicki Gunvalson achieve such a high net worth? And what are her sources of income? In this article, we will explore Vicki Gunvalson’s biography, career, personal life, and net worth in 2023.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h3><p>Vicki Gunvalson was born as Victoria L. Steinmetz on March 27, 1962, in Chicago, Illinois, USA. She grew up in a middle-class family with four siblings. Her father owned a construction company and her mother was a housewife. Vicki learned the value of hard work and financial responsibility from her father, who gave her her first job at Swenson’s Ice Cream Shop when she was 14. She then worked at Wendy’s and Jewel Food Stores while attending Fremd High School in Palatine, Illinois.</p><p>Vicki married her first husband Michael J. Wolfsmith when she was 21 and they had two children, Michael and Briana. At the age of 29, they divorced and Vicki became a single mother. She took a part-time job at her father’s construction company as an accountant to make ends meet. Her father passed away from Alzheimer’s disease in 1991, which motivated Vicki to pursue a career in the insurance industry. She got licensed to sell life and health insurance and joined a captive insurance company as an agent. Within a year, she became the top salesperson of the company.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Career and Business</strong></h3><p>In 1994, Vicki moved from Chicago to Coto de Caza, California, and married Donn Gunvalson. She also founded her own insurance agency, Coto Insurance and Financial Services, with a home-based office. She started from scratch and built a reputation for providing quality service and products to her clients. She expanded her business by hiring other agents, opening new offices, and offering more services such as retirement planning, annuities, long-term care, and estate planning.</p><p>In 2005, Vicki was cast as one of the original housewives on the Bravo reality TV show The Real Housewives of Orange County (RHOC). The show follows the lives of affluent women living in Orange County, California. Vicki became one of the most popular and controversial characters on the show, known for her outspoken personality, work ethic, family drama, and love life. She appeared on 14 seasons of the show from 2006 to 2020 and earned a salary of $500 thousand per season, making her the highest-paid housewife on the show.</p><p>Vicki also ventured into other business endeavors such as writing books, hosting podcasts, launching a skincare line, and producing vodka. She wrote two books: More Than a Housewife (2009), which is a memoir and self-help book; and Internet Life Insurance Selling Made Easy (2012), which is a guide for insurance agents who want to sell online. She hosted a podcast called Whoop It Up with Vicki (2020), where she interviewed celebrities, experts, and friends about various topics. She launched a skincare line called V by Vicki (2015), which featured products such as moisturizers, serums, cleansers, and masks. She also produced a vodka brand called Vicki’s Vodka (2013), which was later involved in a lawsuit with her former business partner.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Personal Life and Relationships</strong></h3><p>Vicki has been married twice and divorced twice. She married her first husband Michael J. Wolfsmith in 1982 and they had two children: Michael Wolfsmith (born in 1986) and Briana Culberson (born in 1987). They divorced in 1991 after nine years of marriage. Vicki married her second husband Donn Gunvalson in 1994 and they had no children together. They divorced in 2014 after 20 years of marriage.</p><p>Vicki has also dated several men after her divorces.
