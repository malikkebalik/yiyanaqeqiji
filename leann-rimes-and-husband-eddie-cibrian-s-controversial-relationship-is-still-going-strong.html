And more recently, she wowed her fans by doing a cameo in the show&nbsp;Country Comfort. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>What made it a pleasant surprise is that her husband Eddie Cibrian stars as the main lead. While Cibrian's romance is not with Rimes on the screen, their chemistry reflects their love-filled relationship off the screen.</p><p>Here's a look into how they got together and how things are going for them.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>From Rock Bottom To Mountain Top</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In a 2011 appearance on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>The Ellen Show</a>, Rimes candidly confronted numerous rumors about her previous relationships. By this point in time, she had been married and divorced from professional backup dancer&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dean Sheremet</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>They had tied the knot back in 2002 and severed it eight years later, in September 2009. An affair between Rimes and Cibrian scandalously preceded the divorce.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>When the anonymous relationship had come to light, Sheremet spoke about how their marriage was already a crumbling one. He revealed that the gap of sacrifices and compromises between were just too big since he was a dancer and a superstar.&nbsp;</p><h2>How It Adds Up</h2><p>Ironically, one could tell that the couple was meant for each other by how Cibrian cheated on his ex-wife,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Brandi Glanville</a>. Perhaps the couple that cheats together ends up and stays together! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Jokes aside, Cibrian has reflected on the issue, saying that he did not wish anyone was hurt in the process. However, he does not regret his actions as he feels that he and Rimes are in the perfect place they could have ever been.&nbsp;</p><p>Glanville, on the other end of the stick, has not been so welcoming of the split. For understandable and reasonable reasons, she began accusing Rimes of being a lurker and a stalker of her then-husband in 2009.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>As her suspicions grew, so did the accusations.&nbsp;Later in&nbsp; 2010, she split up with Cibrian and bitterly noted that the country singer&nbsp;always gets what she wants. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In 2012, Rimes had checked into rehab, and Glanville had taken the righteous path to wish her well. But, later that year, she changed her tune to comment that she doesn't feel the musician is stable enough to be around her sons when Cibrian is not present.</p><p>The following years saw them going back and forth at each other, but currently, they seemed to have made up to each other. Glanville commented that they get along just fine and enjoy each other's company.</p><p>She is still in their lives for Cibrian's parents and kids, and it is almost like the two are sister-wives. Her words, not ours.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>The Couple Now</h2><p>At age 39 now, LeAnn Rimes and her husband have been married for ten years. They live together with two sons from Cibrian's previous marriage with Glanville.</p><p>Speaking about their marriage, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cibrian told ET Online</a> that they had grown together as a couple. Each day, they find something about each other, and it's the most beautiful thing in the world.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>They have managed to be a couple who trust each other with everything. But, all&nbsp;in all, they simply are head over heels for each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSVlruvedGipJ6rXZqxpbXEZpqimqKerq950Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZaGsnaE%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./net-worth-of-hugh-jackman-in-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Net Worth Of Hugh Jackman In 2024">&larr;
