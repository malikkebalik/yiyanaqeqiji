Advocates for heightened safety measures emphasized the advancements in research and technology that had the potential to make the sport less perilous. Innovations in helmet design, for instance, were hailed as a critical step toward mitigating the risk of head injuries, a concern that had cast a shadow over the sport for years. Supporters of this viewpoint argued that the league must continue to invest in these technologies and be proactive in adopting rule changes that prioritize player well-being.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Patriots_Response_and_Game_Suspension></span>Patriots’ Response and Game Suspension<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Faced with the gravity of Isaiah Bolden’s injury, the NFL showcased a poignant display of its commitment to player welfare that transcended the boundaries of competition.
