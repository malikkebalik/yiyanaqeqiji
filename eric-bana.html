Throughout his career, the veteran Australian actor has appeared in almost every genre of film, including comedies, dramas, and high-budget superhero films.</strong></p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Eric_Bana_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Eric Bana? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>As of 2023, Eric Bana’s net worth is<strong> $45 million.</strong> He made his money by appearing in movies, television shows, and dramas. The actor is well-known for his work as a comedian and television and film producer.</p><p>All of this has contributed significantly to his enormous wealth. He is widely regarded as one of Hollywood’s most fearless and skilled actors, with work in both English-language and foreign-language films.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Eric_Bana_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Eric Bana born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Eric Bana was born on <strong>August 9, 1968</strong>, and will be 54 in 2023. He was born in and raised in Melbourne, Australia. He is of Australian origin, of the Catholic faith, and grew up in Melbourne’s Tullamarine neighborhood. Despite the fact that almost all of Australia’s most well-known actors are relocating to the United States, Bana does not appear to be like many Hollywood actors.</p><p>Despite his celebrity, the well-known Hollywood actor now calls Melbourne home. Eric Bana was inspired by comedian Richard Pryor and became interested in the entertainment industry at a young age. When he was six years old, he began imitating his grandfather and teachers. He attended Penleigh and Essendon Grammar Schools and graduated from Sydney’s National Institute of Dramatic Art.</p><p>He has pursued his passion for motor racing since his childhood. His interest in motorsports, however, was not a passing fad; at the age of 14, he even wanted to drop out of school to become a mechanic. His father, who was adamant that he finish high school and get an education, was the one who stopped him from carrying out the plan, which is why it failed.</p><h2><span id=Is_Eric_Bana_Married_Relationship>Is Eric Bana Married? Relationship</span></h2><p>Eric Bana is a married man. The Australian actor is married to Rebecca Gleeson. Before meeting Eric, Rebecca, an Australian TV publicist, worked in the entertainment industry for local Australian TV networks. They met on the set of Full Frontal while Eric was filming and she was working for Seven Network.</p><p>While they were in America, Eric proposed to her, and everything has been going well since then. They started dating in 1995 and have been together for about 27 years. They’ve been married since 1997, making them one of Hollywood’s most enduring couples.</p><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Eric_Bana_Weight_Hair_Color>How tall is Eric Bana? Weight, Hair Color</span></h2><p>Eric Bana is <strong>6 foot 2 inches tall</strong> and weighs <strong>93 kilograms</strong>. His body measurements are 45-36-16.5 inches. He is wearing a size 12 (US) shoe. His eyes are black and his hair is dark brown.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/without-a-partner-lori-petty-feels-lonely/"}{"1":54}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Comedian</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Producer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Emma Dante</a></h3>Emma Dante estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
