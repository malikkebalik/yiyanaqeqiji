However, Anna isn't Daly's wife. They do plan to get married someday as they are currently engaged. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/11/John%20Daly%20and%20his%20current%20partner%20Anna%20Cladakis%20celebrating%20Christmas-1689070517988.jpg><p>John and Cladakis have been engaged since 2014 and first started dating in 2007. The golfer, who had previously said that he could never trust a woman again is living the best life with Cladakins.&nbsp;</p><p>Daly first crossed paths with her in a Hooters restaurant. Anna lives a quiet life and hasn't disclosed much about herself. But, it is known that she is an entrepreneur and has made few appearances with her fianc√© in the media.</p><h2>About John Daly's Four Failed Marriages</h2><p>John Daly at one point had lost all hope in love because of his four failed marriages. His four ex-spouses are <strong>Sherrie Miller</strong>, <strong>Bettye Fulford</strong>, <strong>Paulette Dean Daly</strong>, and <strong>Dale Crafton</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/11/John%20Daly%20posed%20for%20a%20picture%20with%20a%20cigar%20in%20his%20hand-1689070037441.jpg><p>Dale was his first-ever wife as the two were married from <strong>1987</strong> to <strong>1990</strong>. Bettye (<strong>1992 - 1995</strong>) was John's second spouse. Daly then married Paulette (<strong>1995 - 1999</strong>) as his third wife. Lastly, Sherrie (<strong>2001 - 2007</strong>) was his last spouse.</p><h3>Did John Daly's Ex-Spouse Sherrie Miller Stabbed Him?</h3><p>John&nbsp;Daly's marriage with his last wife, Sherrie made headlines for all the wrong reasons. He alleged that she once stabbed him with a steak knife.</p><p>Daly even filed a report but the case didn't go anywhere as<a href=# rel=nofollow> <i>First</i> <i>Sportz</i> </a>reports that he didn't provide enough evidence.</p><h2>John Daly: Father Of Three Kids</h2><p>John Daly's previous four marriages may have failed but he has a kid with some of them. His kids' names are <strong>John Patrick Daly II, Shynah Hale Daly, </strong>and<strong> Sierra Lynn Daly </strong>and unlike his ex-wives, he shares a good relationship with them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/2/24/304968033_158566143502387_4361620277773341442_n%20(1)-1677236163186.jpg><p>Shynah is the oldest child of the golfer and she was born on <strong>June 10, 1992</strong>. She is the daughter of his most controversial ex-wife, Fulford.&nbsp;</p><p>Sierra was born on <strong>June 1, 1995</strong>, and is the child of Dean. John is the youngest and the only son of Daly born on the same day as rapper <a href=#><strong>Suigeneris</strong></a>, i.e., <strong>July 23, 2003</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Daly's oldest daughter is a photographer by profession and mostly does paid photoshoots for people.

John Jr. is currently, part of the Arkansas Men's Golf.</p><h2>Why Was John Daly's Marriage With Fulford So Controversial?</h2><p>Of all of John Daly's marriages, Fulford is the most popular one but for all the wrong reasons. The problem started with Daly trying to end the relationship with her not too long after she announced her pregnancy.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/11/John%20Daly%20took%20a%20picture%20in%20front%20of%20Hooters%20outlet-1689070683706.jpg><p>It was discovered that she was still legally married to her ex-husband, while in a relationship with him. Another shocking news that came out of Daly's and Fulford's short-lived marriage was the instance of domestic violence.&nbsp;</p><p>The professional golfer had physically assaulted her then-partner by throwing her into a wall. The incident occurred in <strong>December 1992</strong>.</p><h2>Net Worth: How Rich Is John Daly The Golfer?</h2><p>John Daly is a successful golfer and has an estimated net worth of <strong>$2 Million</strong>.

With his four divorce settlements, gambling habits, and failure of his wine label, John Wines took a massive hit on his wealth.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides that, the golfer's reckless spending and wasting of money has also affected his wealth. For instance, he once threw away <strong>$55,000</strong> he had won in the casino just to make a statement to his ex-wife Sherrie. Daly's estimated net worth, if he had been careful with his money, could have been <strong>$65 Million</strong>.</p><h2>A Brief On Daly's Golfing Career</h2><p>John is known for mostly headlines media and tabloids for a lot of wrong reasons.

The website also says that he won his first PGA championship in the debut PGA Tour in <strong>1991</strong> where he was also honored with the Rookie of the Year award.</p><h2>Career As A Singer</h2><p>If you think golf is Daly's only passion then you are wrong, as the man is a singer too.
