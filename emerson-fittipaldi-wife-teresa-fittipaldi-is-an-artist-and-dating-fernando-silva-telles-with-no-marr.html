He was married to Teresa Fittipaldi for almost eight years. In 2002, they stopped seeing each other.</strong></p><p>Since getting divorced, Emerson’s wife has been seeing Fernando Silva Telles, who is her new boyfriend.</p><p>In 1972, Colin Chapman’s Lotus team, which Emerson Fittipaldi was on, won the first World Championship for Brazil. He was also the youngest driver and the F1 champion at the time. Most people remember the racer for riding the famous type 72 in black and gold JPS colors.</p><p>Fittipaldi was the youngest F1 world champion ever and held the record for 33 years. His last few years in Formula One didn’t go well because the Fittipaldi cars weren’t fast enough to compete for wins. Fittipaldi still went on to win two more championships before giving up in 1980.</p><p>Fittipaldi was happy with how technical the sport was. He worked on the karts of Carlos Pace and his older brother Wilson Jr. before he won the Brazilian kart championship. He also did well when he won the CART championship in 1989 and two races in Indianapolis.</p><p>In 1995, the race car driver married Teresa Fittipaldi, who was his second wife. In addition, he had two children with her.</p><figure id=attachment_19257 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-19257 class="wp-caption aligncenter">Emerson Fittipaldi</figure><h2>Teresa Fittipaldi Emerson Fittipaldi, too. Wedlock And Divorce</h2><p>After dating for a few years, Emerson Fittipaldi married his wife, Teresa Fittipaldi, in the mid-1980s. They also have two kids of their own.</p><p>Teresa’s life was full of speed, engine noise, and the smell of gasoline because she married a race car driver.</p><p>They were happy for almost eight years after they got married. They often took their kids, Joana and Luca, to the movies.</p><p>In a monthly issue of Indianapolis magazine, it was said that Emerson chose the movies, but sometimes he let his kids make the choice. They also went around the oceans on Jet Skis or Zips.</p><p>Teresa was also good friends with Emerson’s other son, Jayson, who went to the Baltimore art school. She was also his daughter Tatiana’s step-mother.</p><p>Teresa says that Emerson wanted their son to be a driver because he always said that Luca liked to ski fast. Teresa is one of the best-dressed women in Sao Paulo right now.</p><p>Fittipaldi married economist Rossana Fanucchi in So Paulo, Brazil, at the beginning of December 2012. They had been together for eleven years. Vittoria, who was born in early 2012, and Emerson Jr., who was born in 2007, are their children.</p><p>Emerson Fittipaldi also has a grandson who races for the Red Bull Junior Team. His name is Enzo Fittipaldi. This year, his grandson ran in the Charouz Racing and got sixth place in the championship. The kid had the same number of points as fourth-placed Jack Doohan and fifth-placed Jehan Daruvala.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Live: Who is Ben Rottenborn?

Nobody knows if they’re still together or not.</p><p>LinkedIn says that Telles owns Coinvalores CCVM Ltda, a portfolio and financial management company with a good name around the world. He helps Teresa out a lot with her business and design work as well.</p><p>Even though Teresa has a boyfriend, she has decided to never get married again. “I’ll never get married again,” she says.</p><p>Emerson’s racing career could have been the reason why Teresa and Fittipaldi broke up. Emerson has said that he was very unhappy during his last two years in Formula One. The racer said, “I was too focused on trying to make the team work that I didn’t pay enough attention to my marriage and personal life.”</p><p>Emerson Fittipaldi is happy with his current wife, Rossana Fanucchi, right now.</p><p>Fanucchi’s father, who works for Sportello Participacoes and also studied economics at Mackenzie Presbyterian University, may have passed on his love of the subject to her. Giovanna Fanucchi is her sister from Brazil, and she lives in Sao Paulo.</p><p>In 2001, the race car driver from Brazil and the economist started going out together. In 2012, after 12 years together, they got married. They have a son and a daughter together. Their younger son Emerson Jr. was born in 2007, and their daughter Vittoria was born at the beginning of 2012.</p><p>Emerson Jr. has also started racing, just like his dad did before him. In the 2021 F4 Danish Championship, he finished third overall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/smartindianews.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Emerson-Fittipaldi--300x209.png><h2>Teresa is a mom to two kids, Joana and Luca</h2><p>Teresa Fittipaldi is the mother of Joana and Luca, who are both grown up. She now lives alone in a penthouse in the Sao Paulo neighborhood of Jardins.</p><p>Son Luca lives close by, and daughter Joana has been in New York for 12 years.</p><p>Today, Teresa decides how her life will go. She has said, “I still like excitement sometimes, but I don’t need to be busy and invited to everything to feel alive.” I learned to appreciate solitude. It is in the empty space that you find room to make something.”</p><p>Teresa also has a unique studio in the corner of her home. She had studied the shapes of the female body by looking at plates on the wall.</p><p>Her current collection is made up of organic shapes that look like seaweed and ball vases that look like sculptures of dinosaur eggs from which the hatchlings have been blown out.</p><p>From what I can tell from online sources, Teresa’s family is from Italy. She was born in San Severino, Basilicata, Italy, on January 2, 1880. Saverio Fittipaldi, her father, was said to be 48 years old, and Rosa Ciancio, her mother, was in her 30s when she was born.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Harris Faulkner: What Happened To Her?

She works in the business of designing and decorating homes.</p><p>Her writing has been published in magazines and newspapers.</p><p>Emerson Fittipaldi is a good artist, according to Teresa. She decided that ceramics would be her art form. As soon as she studied visual arts at FAAP in 2002, she became very interested in clay. Her first works were made during this time, and she never stopped making art or going to school.</p><p>Florian Raiss, who died in March 2016, taught her how to make sculptures. She calls out. “I kept going to classes over and over again. Even though the class is great, practice is the best way to learn.</p><p>When Teresa was in kindergarten, her teacher told her mother that she would become a great artist one day. Teresa has fond memories of her mother. “She jokes about it, but when she sees a picture of me with my work in a magazine or a newspaper column, she always thinks of this story.”</p><p>“I wake up here in my space, make my breakfast, put on my apron, and start kneading the clay,” she said. “I never know how it will turn out; each piece has a secret that comes out in its shape, color, and texture.” I like that nothing is ever the same and that the pieces are not all the same. I like that the whole thing can’t be planned for. It’s just like life.”</p><h2 id=emerson_fittipaldi_2022_profile class=smooth-goto>Emerson Fittipaldi 2022 Profile</h2><table border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=1><tbody readability=2><tr><td>Name</td><td>Emerson Fittipaldi</td></tr><tr><td>Real Name</td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Race Car Driver</td></tr><tr><td>Date of Birth</td><td>12 December 1946</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>75 years old</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Birthplace</td><td>São Paulo, State of São Paulo, Brazil</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Brazilian</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth 2022</td><td>$1.5 Million</td></tr></tbody></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/smartindianews.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Emerson-Fittipaldi-2-300x242.png><h2>Biography of Emerson Fittipaldi</h2><p>Emerson Fittipaldi was born in Brazil on December 12, 1946.
