The current president and co-owner of Salford City and Inter Miami is David Robert Joseph Beckham OBE, a former professional football player from England.</strong></p><p>Beckham is regarded as one of the top set-piece specialists of all time and one of the greatest and most well-known midfielders of his period.</p><p>As a right winger, he is renowned for his versatility in passing, crossing, and bending free kicks.</p><p>Because of his skill and achievements for both club and country, Beckham is also regarded as one of the greatest Manchester United players of all time. He was also among the best English athletes in the annals of the sport.</p><p>As the only player from England to have won league titles in England, France, Spain, and the US, he is the first of his kind.</p><p>Beckham’s professional club career began when he made his Manchester United first-team debut at the age of 17. He won the FA Cup twice with United, the Premier League six times, and the UEFA Champions League in 1999.</p><h2>Affair And Scandal With David Beckham</h2><p>The startling information about the David Beckham affair! The infidelity controversy involving David Beckham and his alleged affair with Rebecca Loos. We think back to David’s purported relationship with Rebecca Loos as the couple disputes new claims of adultery and divorce.</p><p>If the most famous soccer player in the world was married to a pop music legend, what could possibly go wrong?</p><p>Rumors of alleged infidelity have plagued David and Victoria Beckham’s relationship almost since their 1999 nuptials. Among these rumors, the most prominent one concerned David and Rebecca Loos, his former assistant.</p><p>Furthermore, it seems that the Beckhams might be the subject of new accusations of infidelity after the weekend’s explosion of Twitter speculations about adultery and an impending divorce.</p><p>Following this, Victoria, 44, and David, 43, released a statement labeling the current reports “fake news” and disputing them.</p><p>When Rebecca Loos made the well-known accusation in 2003 that she had an affair with the soccer champion, David and Victoria responded with identical letters to support their partnership. This may feel familiar to you since they did this back then.</p><h2>On Victoria’s Reddit, did he cheat?</h2><p>In 2003, David was playing football in his prime. The captain of England was moved for an enormous fee from his native Manchester United to Real Madrid in Spain. His celebrity had never been greater, but there was a surprise in store for the Beckhams.</p><p>In September of that year, David was seen with a lady at a nightclub in Madrid. Eventually, the lady was identified as his personal assistant, Rebecca Loos.</p><p>Then, the gossip machine went into overdrive, spreading stories that David and Victoria Beckham’s marriage was in jeopardy, which David denied.</p><p>There was also news of the two exchanging explicit messages. Victoria allegedly told the assistant to avoid a message that was intended for her.</p><p>In a brand-new Netflix documentary series, David Beckham explores the horrific abuse he faced and its impact on him after his infamous red card from the 1998 World Cup. The series is scheduled to coincide with the tenth anniversary of his retirement.</p><p>During a video interview that was exclusively provided to The Associated Press, Beckham compared the “Beckham” series to an emotional rollercoaster. “I have never discussed these particular periods of my life and career.”</p><p>The personal four-part documentary explores Beckham’s upbringing, marriage to his wife, and accomplishments in sports. The worst aspect was certainly having to repeat his devastating expulsion from England’s World Cup match against Argentina.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
