Here are the details about Nicole Shanahan, who is just as successful as her famous ex-husband.</p><p class=dh>Two of the most influential entrepreneurs are making news worldwide after one of them allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan. Elon Musk reportedly had a romantic affair with Shanahan behind the latter's husband, Google co-founder and computer scientist Sergey Brin.</p><p class=dh>The 51-year-old Tesla CEO, who has long been acquainted with Brin, reportedly denied having an affair with Shanahan. Brin, a Russian-born business magnate, divorced his ex-wife earlier this year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/9dd5351e31ab52b8e125613090d14500.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Nicole Shanahan, president of Bia-Echo Foundation, attends Gold House's Inaugural Gold Gala: A New Gold Age at Vibiana on May 21, 2022, in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>WHO IS NICOLE SHANAHAN?</strong></p><p class=dh>Shanahan is a lawyer and an entrepreneur who <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://law.stanford.edu/directory/nicole-shanahan/>studied</a> at Stanford Law School and founded her tech company, ClearAcessIP.</p><p class=dh>She is also the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-shanahan-85831b18/>president</a> of the Bia-Echo Foundation. This private organization invests in entrepreneurs solving some of the world's most pressing issues revolving around the environment, criminal justice reforms, and health.</p><p class=dh>Shanahan's present accomplishments are the result of hard work. Despite having had a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://nypost.com/2022/07/25/who-is-nicole-shanahan-who-had-an-affair-with-elon-musk/>tough childhood</a>, she said she was already driven to succeed and survive.

She said she had three unsuccessful efforts at embryo production and several unproductive trips to several IVF clinics, which left her feeling frustrated.</p><p class=dh>Instead of being upset, she turned her frustrations into motivation and decided to help women who struggled with infertility. She used her Bia-Echo Foundation to create programs for reproductive longevity and equality.</p><p class=dh>Shanahan donated <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.philanthropy.com/article/nicole-shanahan-gives-100-million-for-reproductive-research-and-other-causes/>$100 million</a> to reproductive research that aids women in becoming pregnant in the future.
