Everything in my mind said, Pac, pretend you’re dead. It didn’t matter. They started kicking me, hitting me. I never said, ‘Don’t shoot!’ I was quiet as hell,” Shakur said in an April 1995 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vibe magazine</a>.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Rapper Tupac Shakur poses for photos backstage after his performance at the Regal Theater in Chicago, Illinois in March 1994 <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Shakur suggested that Bad Boy Records producer Sean Combs (Puff Daddy) and rapper Christopher Wallace (Notorious B.I.G) were at the studio and may have been aware he was being set up.</p><p>“Puffy was there, Biggie… there was about 40 n—as there.

Mr. Shakur began talking to the women. We couldn’t really hear what he was saying. We assumed he was probably inviting them to the club,” Greenidge told the grand jury that indicted Davis, according to reports.</p><p>Moments later, the women pulled away, and a white Cadillac quietly crept alongside Knight’s BMW.</p><p>“An arm came out of the back window and began shooting,” Greenidge told the grand jury.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The BMW Shakur was shot near the Las Vegas Strip. <span class=credit>The LIFE Images Collection/Getty</span></figure><p>The shooter fired over a dozen rounds into the car in a matter of seconds before the Cadillac peeled off.</p><p>Shakur was hit with four bullets — taking two of them to his chest.</p><p>Knight was only grazed in the head by a bullet fragment, according to reports.</p><p>Around 11:20 p.m., police and paramedics arrived, and Shakur was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada&nbsp;Hospital.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Shakur during a concert at the Regal Theater in Chicago, Illinois in March 1994. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sep. 13, 1996: Tupac dies</h2><p>Having undergone multiple surgeries — including having to be placed on a respirator after having a lung removed — Shakur would battle in the ICU for nearly a week before succumbing to his injuries.</p><p>The “Changes” rapper died of cardiac arrest.&nbsp;He was 25.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>March 9, 1997: Biggie is killed in LA</h2><p>The Notorious B.I.G. is shot and killed in Los Angeles.
