He began earning enough money from YouTube in 2016 to live in the Stratford Halo in his flat. Ethan moved out of this flat in September 2017 into a new apartment near the O2 Arena.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He relocated to a new apartment in London in 2020, for which he filmed an apartment tour.
