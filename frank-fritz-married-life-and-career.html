He made an appearance in the program with Mike Wolfe.</strong></p><p>Frank is no longer on the show as of right now. His final episode of the show’s 21st season aired in March 2020. Many questions were raised by his abrupt departure from the show, but it was eventually discovered that he took a leave of absence because of a health issue.</p><h2><span id=Frank_Fritz8217s_Childhood>Frank Fritz’s Childhood</span></h2><p>Frank was born in Davenport, Iowa, on October 11, 1965. He is the sole child of Bill Fritz and Susan Kay Zerbes. His parents divorced shortly after he was born and never got married. Before Frank began to appear on the show, there was no interaction between him and his biological father, who later moved to Texas.</p><p>After his mother married Richard Dick Zirbes in 1974, Frank was reared by both his mother and his stepfather.</p><p>His stepfather was a tire salesman, and his mother had previously worked for a construction company. In December 2013, Frank’s mother passed away at the age of 67.</p><p>Fritz was raised primarily on Davenport’s Mound Street throughout his formative years.</p><h2><span id=He_Started_Picking_at_an_Early_Age>He Started Picking at an Early Age</span></h2><p>Frank had always collected things, even as a young child. His passion in collecting began when he enrolled at Davenport’s Sudlow Intermediate School. He collected rocks, beer cans, stamps, and coins, among other items.</p><p>From his house, Frank would follow the train tracks to the community of East Davenport, where he would frequently come upon abandoned goods left behind by railroad vagrants.</p><p>He has always had a talent for unearthing treasure among abandoned objects, and his abilities eventually brought him the highly regarded role in the television series American Picker. What had begun as a childhood pastime for him became a full-time passion.</p><h2><span id=Frank_was_a_fire_inspector_by_trade>Frank was a fire inspector by trade.</span></h2><p>Though many of us first became familiar with Frank through the television series American Picker, the man had previously had a different life. He was a fire inspector once. As an inspector, he worked in the Des Moines to Cedar Falls region.</p><p>Even though he was working in a different field at the time, he was always interested in collecting. He was collecting firefighter and firehouse memorabilia even back then.</p><p>Frank once spent $15 on an item that he later sold for $475, winning the lottery instantly. Frank was inspired by this and made the decision to pursue this as a career. He then resigned from his position in 2002 and founded Frank’s Finds.</p><p>Speaking on his life at the time, Fritz stated,</p><p>“I was in a position to accomplish it. Many of the intelligentest, wealthiest, and most knowledgeable people on the planet haven’t made a decision or reached a crossroads in their lives.</p><h2><span id=Frank_Fritz_Has_A_Passion_For_Motorbikes>Frank Fritz Has A Passion For Motorbikes</span></h2><p>Frank has a passion for motorbikes. He’d dreamed of collecting vintage motorcycles since he was little.</p><p>His extensive motorcycle collection is frequently on display at events such as Daytona Bike Week, AIMExpo, the National Motorcycle Museum, and the KC Remodel + Garden Show.</p><p>Among his many collections are a 1954 Harley-Davidson Panhead motorbike, a Honda 750, and a Heinz 57.</p><p>Frank enrolled in Bettendorf High School while he was in his late teens. He initially met Mike Wolfe, who would go on to be his co-star, here.</p><p>At the time, Mike was more interested in gathering objects like used bicycles and abandoned jack-o’-lanterns.</p><p>For many years, they stayed close friends before their friendship developed into the charismatic pair that won over the hearts of countless admirers all over the world.</p><h2><span id=2010_saw_him_join_American_Pickers>2010 saw him join American Pickers.</span></h2><p>The program premiered on January 18, 2010. With 3.1 million viewers, its debut was the highest-rated program on the History network.</p><p>Along with Mike Wolfe, a friend from high school, and Danielle Colby, the manager of Antique Archaeology, he entered the program.</p><h2><span id=The_21st_season_of_the_show_ended_with_Frank8217s_departure>The 21st season of the show ended with Frank’s departure.</span></h2><p>Frank abruptly left the show after making an appearance for ten years. March 2020 saw the release of his farewell episode, which came just months before the 21st season finale.</p><p>Frank and the network didn’t share any information about his departure at the time. Unable to ascertain the cause, fans began conjecturing that it might be because of the Covid-19 outbreak or perhaps an underlying medical condition.</p><p>But when Fritz exposed the truth to The Sun in an all-exclusive interview, all the whispers came to a stop.</p><p>Frank stated in his own words,</p><p>I stayed at the show. After I wrapped the filming, I underwent minor back surgery, and then the pandemic struck.</p><h2><span id=The_Conflict_Between_Mike_and_Frank_Wolfe>The Conflict Between Mike and Frank Wolfe</span></h2><p>It’s possible that many of you are already aware of Frank and Mike’s fight. Frank attacked Mike, his former co-star, in an interview with the Sun.</p><p>Frank says that his connection with Mike was never really good.</p><p>Fritz posted about Fritz leaving the program, and in reaction he remarked, “Mike’s statement was bulls***, somebody wrote it out for him.”</p><p>Frank also stated that he and Wolfe were never buddies. As to his statement, after his difficult recovery from back surgery, Mike failed to even inquire about him.</p><p>Fritz is no longer a cast member, and while we may speculate about the reasons for his exit, one thing is certain: we shall miss him greatly.</p><h2><span id=Frank_Fritz_was_previously_involved_in_a_marriage>Frank Fritz was previously involved in a marriage.</span></h2><p>When it comes to his private life, Frank is a very private person. His present romantic situation is still very much a mystery.</p><p>Having said that, the man was previously engaged to Diann Bankson. He first began exchanging photos with his then-fiance in 2016.</p><p>The previous fires were residents of Frank’s Iowan farmstead. Before everything broke down, things between the two were going well.</p><p>His fiancé Diann filed a negligence lawsuit against him in a court document that The Sun was able to get. According to the January 2020 filing, Frank set off fireworks in their home, resulting in third-degree burns on Diann.</p><p>In addition, Diann stated that Frank had an extramarital affair. She discovered him in bed with a different woman back in November of 2018.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Cecilia Allman, Marian Krawstor, and Bronlie Jacobs."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":62}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/cecilia-allman/"}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":"https://popularbio.com/marian-krawstor/"}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":"https://popularbio.com/bronlie-jacobs/"}{"1":62}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cecilia Allman</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Marian Krawstor</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Bronlie Jacobs</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>collector</a> <a href=# rel=tag>TV personality</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Kaniehtiio Horn Husband | Is She Married To Bradley LaRocque | Family And Net Worth</a></h3>Kaniehtiio Horn is a Canadian actress best known for her appearances in "Moccasin Flats" and "The Legend of Korra."
