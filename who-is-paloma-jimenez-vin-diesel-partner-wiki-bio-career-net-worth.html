And even though the pair’s union was rocked in 2016 after Diesel’s alleged affair came to light. While Diesel denied all rumors and the pair brushed them aside, it might be a wake-up call for Jimenez and cause her to re-evaluate her relationship with Diesel. A Mexican model and actress, Jimenz is best known for her relationship with Vin Diesel. And while she has enjoyed a considerably successful career as a model, Jimenez put her career on hold to take care of her children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life:</h2><p>Karla Paloma Jiménez Denagustin was born on the 22nd of August 1983, in Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico. Born and raised in a major seaport in the state of Guerrero on the Pacific coast of Mexico, not much is known about Jimenez’s early life. Jimenez was interested in acting and modeling from a very young age and had her work cut out. She graduated from a local high school in 2001 and started working as a professional model.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Vin-Diesel-Partner-Paloma-Jimenez.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional Career:</h2><p>Owing to her stunning looks, Jimenez was able to turn heads in the modeling industry. Eventually, she made it to the front page of Maxim Mexico in 2005 and was signed by ID Model Management. Over the years, Jimenz has been represented by different agencies including ID Model Management and Look Models of Mexico. But for all the agencies she has worked with, Jimenez found the most success while working with Two Management, as she landed gigs with popular companies including Coca-Cola and Honda.</p><p>In 2005, Jimenez was also featured on the cover of ‘Max’ magazine. Over the years, Jimenez has regularly attended the Ready to Wear Spring/Summer fashion show and has walked the ramp for the likes of Alberto Rodríguez, Carlo Demichelis, Citrico, Guillermo Vargas, Hector Terrones, Jorge Castellanos Carmona, Lily of France, and Roberto Villareal.

Their first child Hania Riley Sinclair was born on April 2, 2008, and has followed in her parent’s footsteps working as a voice-over artist on the animation series “Fast and Furious Spy Racer.” She was followed by Vincent Sinclair born in 2010 and Pauline Sinclair born in 2017. Following the birth of her children, Jimenez decided to quit the ramp and committed to raising their children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Controversy:</h2><p>In 2016, it was reported that Vin had cheated on Jimenez and had an illicit affair while in New York. While Vin promptly denied the claims, several sources reported that Diesel and Jimenez were calling things off. A source even released a statement <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>citing </a>Diesel’s affairs.</p><p>“Vin has a double life. About a year ago, he met this girl at a party in NYC. They hit it off, one thing led to another and before you knew it, they were making out … That little fling turned into something more, which lasted for a couple of months. Vin and the woman had a whirlwind romance, based on sex. Vin’s secret was safe (until now) because the woman was also in a long-term relationship.”</p><p>Despite the accusations, Diesel and Jimenez have continued to remain together and the rumors have disappeared from the media.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A quick write on Vin Diesel:</h2><p>Vin Diesel, whose real name is Mark Sinclair, is an American actor, producer, director, and screenwriter.
