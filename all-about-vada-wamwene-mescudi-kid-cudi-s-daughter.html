She is known for being the daughter of an American rapper, producer, and actor, Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi aka Kid Cudi.</p><p>She started to gain a little fame at the age of twelve, all thanks to her father, Scott. Her date of birth is <strong>March 26, 2010</strong>, and her nationality is American.&nbsp;</p><h2>About Her Father Kid Cudi</h2><p>Kid Cudi is one of the growing names in the rap industry. He has been actively working in the industry since <strong>2008</strong>, and his career has only gone uphill from there, be it rapping or acting.</p><p>He has given a lot of hit songs like <i>Mr. Rager, Soundtrack To My Life, The Prayer,</i> and so on, but his most famous song is easily <i>Pursuit of Happiness</i> which, as of 2022, has over <strong>400 million</strong> streams on Spotify.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/11/6/kid-cudi-daughter-vada-kids-choice-awards-081722-a0beeff3f7cc497480b39de81625a22e%20(1)-1667726569486.jpg><p>Apart from Music, the <i>Show Out</i> singer also is an actor and has been working in the film industry for a while now. His works include <i>How To Make It In America, Need For Speed, Entourage, </i>and<i> Brooklyn Nine-Nine.</i></p><h2>What Is Her Father's Net Worth?</h2><p>Vada Wamwene Mescudi's father, Kid Cudi, has fame and made a fortune with his music and movie career. The <i>Just What I Am</i> singer has an estimated net worth of<i> </i><strong>$16 million.</strong></p><p>He has been involved with many considerable projects in his career. <i>Westworld, Need For Speed, </i>and<i> X</i> are just some of the vast projects that he has worked on. Besides that, his music career is booming as well. He averages monthly listeners of <strong>23.5 million</strong> on his Spotify and has sold over <strong>22 million</strong> records so far.</p><h2>Cudi's Time In Rehab</h2><p>Unfortunately, Vada had to witness her father go to rehab at a young age. Her father was in recovery in <strong>2016</strong>. He was thirty-two years old at the time.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Amanda Bynes's</a> ex-boyfriend, Cudi, has been suffering his whole life. He saw his father die when he was just 11. He also revealed that he didn't express himself much as a kid. His time in rehab ended up being fruitful for him. But things didn't go entirely as planned.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/11/6/Ct-dWcnW8AEdr8N%20(2)%20(1)-1667727016805.jpg><p>While in recovery, he suffered a <strong>stroke</strong>. It happened after only two weeks of his entering the rehab. The situation was terrible, but he made it through at the end of the day. He is now in the best state of his life and doesn't hate himself anymore. He said:</p><p>I actually can say, at 38, that I love myself. And I couldn’t have said that six years ago. I can say that with confidence now and truly believe it, and it shows.</p><h2>Who Is Vada Wamwene Mescudi Mother?</h2><p>Vada's father, Kid Cudi, is a famous man among Hollywood peers. But what about her mother? Who is She?</p><p>Well, her mother's name is <strong>Jacqueline Munyasa</strong>. Not much is known about her other than that she is an actor. She only gained popularity after getting into a relationship with the<i> </i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Pursuit of Happiness</i></a> singer.</p><h2>How Does Vada Feel About Cudi's Fame?</h2><p>Vada Wamwene Mescudi has experienced what life's like with fame. While many dreams of having a life like that, Vada is not a fan of it. At least, that's what Cudi said in his interview with <i>Esquire</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/11/6/BpQDOBVCUAE4gGG%20(1)-1667727313531.jpg><p>Cudi recalled the incident when he was with his daughter. The two fans approached, and he went to take pictures. Vada was sad because she just wanted to spend time with her father. The <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Don't Look Up</i></a> actor even lets fans learn about it. He told his fans:</p><p>Let this be an APB for everybody out there. Please, if you see me with my daughter, let us have our moment. This is Vada asking, not me.</p><h2>Vada's Parents Are No Longer Together</h2><p>Sadly for Vada, she won't grow up with her parents living under the same roof. Her father, Kid Cudi, and mother, Jacqueline Munyasa, have gone their separate ways.&nbsp;</p><p>Though their relationship timeline is unclear, it is understood that the pair never exchanged their wedding vows. We have also learned that the relationship between them didn't end on a positive note looking at the custody battle for Vada between them.</p><h2>Her Father Is Travis Scott's Favorite</h2><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Stormi Webster's</a> father, Travis Scott, is one of the biggest names in the hip-hop industry today. He has given popular songs like <i>SICKO MODE, Highest In The Room </i>and<i> goosebumps</i>. It was a surprise for his fans that his favorite rapper is Kid Cudi.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/11/6/c1d4f3da160965993b41da3a8bfeaebb%20(1)-1667727159066.jpg><p>Jacques Webster II (real name Travis Scott) revealed that his rap name came from Cudi. Travis is the name of his favorite uncle, whereas Scott is the actual name of Cudi. That's how he came up with his rap name Travis Scott.</p><p>Regarding his favorite rapper, this is what Travis said in his Interview with <i>Beats 1</i>:</p><p>I idolise Kid Cudi a lot. That’s like, my favorite artist. I think he can go bar to bar—like some people think Jay Z is the best rapper. I feel like he can compete with that and still have his own wave.</p><h2>The Messy Custody Battle Between Vada Wamwene Mescudi Parents</h2><p>The matters between Cudi and Jacqueline remain undisclosed. But, it can be assumed things weren't rosy between the two when you look at their custody battle for Vada.</p><p>The legal custody battle on keeping the daughter happened after these two broke up. The struggle continued for a while before the court gave a verdict in favor of the mother.</p><p>However, things only got messier from there. Much later, Jacqueline went to court seeking protection after the rapper reportedly sent her threats. She reported that Cudi had sent 168 texts in four days.</p><h2>A Quick Glance At Vada's Father Beef With Kanye West:</h2><p>Vada Wamwene Mescudi's father, Kid Cudi, is loved by many, but he does have rivalries among his industry peers. His most famous beef came with fellow rapper Kanye West.</p><p>West's ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, famously after ending things with him, started dating actor and comedian <a href=# rel=nofollow>Pete Davidson</a>. This led to a substantial public fight where Kanye constantly called him out numerous times.</p><p>This affected Cudi's relations with him since he was on good terms with Pete. The fight between the two first came out when Kanye removed Cudi's portion from his album <i>Donda 2</i>. In reply, Cudi famously called him a dinosaur for his actions.&nbsp;</p><figure class=media></figure><p>In an Interview, Cudi went all out and didn't hesitate to speak about what he felt about his situation with West. He said:</p><p>I'm not one of your kids. I'm not Kim. It don't matter if I'm friends with Pete or not friends with Pete. None of this s*** had anything to do with me. If you can't be a grown man and deal with the fact that you lost your woman? That's not my f***ing problem. You need to own up to your s*** like every man in this life has. I've lost women, too. And I've had to own up to it. I don't need that in my life. I don't need it.</p><p><i><strong>Check Out </strong></i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></i></a><i><strong> for more exciting Celebrity bios.</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jq%2BYnZldrK6uw8SnnGallaiwtrDI</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./erin-dana-lichy-american-real-estate-agent-tv-personality-age-biography-wiki-net-worth-care.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Erin DanaLichy- American Real Estate Agent, TV Personality | Age, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth, Care">&larr;
