Winfrey purchased the property for $50 million in 2001.</p><p>In April 2020, Winfrey revealed that Graham was temporarily staying in the guest house due to his travels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Winfrey had recently recovered from a bronchial infection and pneumonia the previous year. She made the decision to have Graham quarantine in the guest house because of social distancing guidelines. She said, “Stedman is like ‘What’s the procedure for coming home?’ The procedure is…you ain’t coming and sleeping in my bed! And literally, he goes, ‘I’m not?’ And I go, ‘Have you not been paying attention to the news? Social distancing does not mean you go and sleep in the same bed with the person! When you just got off American Airlines!'”</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC%2F056bppmeYrSzrceapGamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hayley-williams-age-net-worth-bio-wiki-wife-kids-weight.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hayley Williams Age, Net worth: Bio-Wiki, Wife, Kids, Weight">&larr;
