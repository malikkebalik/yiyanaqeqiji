Its melody, upbeat sound, and catchy chorus, have become a staple in American rock music. However, the lyrics tell a story of the struggle of the Vietnam War veterans returning from the war and their struggle to find their place in a society that they no longer recognize.</p><br><p>The opening lyrics introduce the singer, born in a "dead man's town," with the "first kick" being vividly compared to being "beat too much." The song reflects the bitterness and disillusionment of a generation, largely ignored by the government and society, the veterans who served in the armed forces and who were left behind without any help or support.</p><br><p>The second verse speaks about the singer being drafted into the military and sent overseas to fight in the Vietnam War. He returns home to be met with disdain and rejection by civilians and struggling veterans both, emphasizing the pain of grappling with PTSD alone. The closing line "I'm a cool rocking daddy in the USA now" reflects the singer's disowned persona and the irony that his military service led him from a victimized youth to a rebellious misanthrope.</p><br><p>Born in the USA was initially intended as an anti-war ballad, with a slower, more acoustic version presented to Congress in December of 1983. However, after receiving the tune sheet and listening to the song's revised and upbeat version, President Reagan used the track's refrain in political campaigns, considering it a right-wing nationalist anthem while not comprehending its actual message.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Born down in a dead man's town</u><br>I was born in a place with no prospects and opportunities.</p><br><p><u>The first kick I took was when I hit the ground</u><br>I was born into a world of violence and struggle.</p><br><p><u>End up like a dog that's been beat too much</u><br>Growing up in such an environment means that you carry emotional scars for life.</p><br><p><u>'Til you spend half your life just to cover it up now</u><br>It's hard to succeed after being beaten down, so you try your hardest to hide your past.</p><br><p><u>Got in a little hometown jam</u><br>Got into some trouble in my small town.</p><br><p><u>So they put a rifle in my hands</u><br>The only option presented to me was to join the military and go to war.</p><br><p><u>Sent me off to a foreign land</u><br>I was sent overseas to fight in an unpopular war.</p><br><p><u>To go and kill the yellow man</u><br>I was sent to fight an enemy I had no personal reason to hate.</p><br><p><u>Come back home to the refinery</u><br>After returning from war, my only option for work was in the factory.</p><br><p><u>Hiring man said, "Son if it was up to me"</u><br>The factory boss would not have offered me a job if it wasn't the last resort.</p><br><p><u>Went down to see my VA man</u><br>I tried to get help from the Veteran's Association.</p><br><p><u>He said, "Son, don't you understand now?"</u><br>The VA tried to make me understand that I was simply a pawn used in the war.</p><br><p><u>I had a brother at Khe Sanh</u><br>I lost a family member in the Vietnam War.</p><br><p><u>Fighting off all the Viet Cong</u><br>He fought an enemy in Vietnam that he didn't understand or care about.</p><br><p><u>They're still there, he's all gone</u><br>The war is still going on and he died for nothing.</p><br><p><u>Down in the shadow of the penitentiary</u><br>Life is so bleak that it's easy to end up in jail.</p><br><p><u>Out by the gas fires of the refinery</u><br>Work is hard, stressful, and dangerous.</p><br><p><u>I'm ten years burning down the road</u><br>I've been dealing with this pain for ten years.</p><br><p><u>Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go</u><br>There's no way out of this cycle of pain and struggle.</p><br><p><u>I'm a long gone Daddy in the USA now</u><br>I'm an absentee father who can't provide for his family.</p><br><p><u>I'm a cool rocking Daddy in the USA now</u><br>I put on a façade of coolness to hide my pain and struggle.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group, Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC<br>Written by: Bruce Springsteen</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maHqiqrCmq7KpqaKml6jBprHNaHmoqp6Utq%2Br06GcmI2Ddg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./janet-panetta-dies-at-75-remembering-a-renowned-ballet-dancer-and-trainer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Janet Panetta dies At 75: Remembering A Renowned Ballet Dancer and Trainer">&larr;
