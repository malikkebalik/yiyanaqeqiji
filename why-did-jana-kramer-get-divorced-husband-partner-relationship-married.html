She made her acting debut in the low-budget horror film “Dead/Undead” and later had a recurring role on the popular soap opera “All My Children.” However, it was her role as Alex Dupre on the television series “One Tree Hill” that truly brought her into the spotlight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/c6da6752bdef3cc610fda13a1f683351.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Entering_the_World_of_Country_Music></span><strong>Entering the World of Country Music</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2012, Jana Kramer decided to explore a different facet of her talent and ventured into the world of country music. She released her debut single, “Why Ya Wanna,” which quickly climbed the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart’s top 10. Following her successful single, she released her self-titled debut album, which produced two more top 10 hits, “I Got the Boy” and “What I Want.”</p><p>Her second album, “Thirty-One,” came out in 2015, featuring songs like “Pray,” “Circles,” and “I Got My Baby.” It’s clear that Jana Kramer is a multi-talented individual who has made significant contributions to both the acting and music industries.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Ups_and_Downs_of_Personal_Life></span><strong>The Ups and Downs of Personal Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Jana Kramer’s professional life was on the rise, her personal life had its share of challenges. In 2015, she married her third husband, Mike Caussin, and they seemed like a happy couple. However, their relationship was marred by difficulties. Caussin admitted to infidelity and entered treatment for sex addiction in 2016. Despite this, Kramer forgave him, and they reconciled. But the trust was shattered again in 2019 when Caussin cheated on her once more.</p><p>In April 2021, Jana Kramer decided that she had reached her breaking point. She filed for divorce from Mike Caussin, citing “inappropriate marital conduct, irreconcilable differences, and adultery” as the reasons behind their separation. In her words, she was “forced” to file for divorce because Caussin “didn’t want to be married anymore.”</p><p>The emotional and psychological toll of Caussin’s infidelity took a significant toll on Jana Kramer. She openly shared her struggles with anxiety, depression, and trust issues, shining a light on the devastating impact that infidelity can have on a relationship.</p><p>In a revealing interview on the Red Table Talk, Kramer disclosed that Caussin had been unfaithful to her with over 13 women during their marriage. He even told her that he “never really loved” her. Kramer’s courage in speaking out about her experience has earned her praise and has helped raise awareness of the issue of infidelity.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jana_Kramer_Life_After_Divorce></span><strong>Jana Kramer Life After Divorce</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Jana-Kramer-Speaks-Out-After-Filing-for-Divorce-From-Mike-Caussin-1024x1024.webp><p>Since her divorce from Caussin, Jana Kramer has been focused on healing and moving forward.
