On the same topic, she is well known for interviewing former President of the Soviet Union, <strong>Mikhail Gorbachev</strong>, who knew the codes to the nuclear war power in Russia.</p><p>Apart from Fuller's interest in the journalism field, she is an avid yoga practitioner. Also, she goes fishing during vacation time. More upon this, her traveling destination covered all parts of Europe, Africa, and Cuba as well. One of her favorite places in Paris, France, and wishes to explore Asia in the coming days.</p><h2>Is Karen Fuller Married? Does She Have Children?</h2><p>The <i>64-years-old</i>, Karen Fuller is a happily married woman. Though the identity of her husband is still mysterious as of now. It seems like she prefers her married life to be off-the-closet. Meanwhile, she professionally proclaimed her fellow CBS2 co-news anchor, <strong>Scott Sanborn </strong>as her on-air TV husband in one of her Facebook posts on <i>14th September 2015</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/6/8/0309-k25_kpvoxs-1623168117950.jpg><p>On the other hand, Karen is a caring wife and loving mother to two children, including a 19-years-old son, <strong>Quinn Fuller</strong>, and a 20-years-old daughter, <strong>Blaise Fuller</strong>. Currently, the Fuller family resides in Cedar Rapids, Iowa with their two pet cats.</p><p><i><strong>Another news anchor </strong></i><a href=#><strong>Tracy Kornet</strong></a><i><strong> is also in a blissful marital relationship with her husband</strong></i> <strong>Frank Kornet</strong></p><h2>Karen Settle Down Her Discrimination Lawsuit against Meredith Corp</h2><p>Former <i>KCTV </i>news anchor, Karen settled her age and gender discrimination lawsuit, which she sued against a media company, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Meredith Corp</a><i>. </i>The reason behind her major decision to file a lawsuit is because of the company's "age ceiling," for its female news anchors while male news anchors are free of age.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Fuller's contract with the KCTV news team did not renew several times, and they then terminated her contract by saying, "she was too old and unattractive." Back in <i>2015</i>, Meredith's NBC News-affiliated TV station forced her to leave after 10 years of service. When she left the news station, she was 58 years old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/6/6/The%20Kansas%20City%20Star%20(1)-1622965578819.jpg><p>During that time, Karen raised her voice by filing a discrimination lawsuit case at the federal court of Kansas City, Kansas in late <i>2015</i>. In her lawsuit, she proclaimed that overall 17 TV stations under Meredith media company set the maximum age for a woman to work as a news anchor as 40 whilst a man can work up to 51 years.</p><p>According to the attorneys of Meredith company, Fuller's news anchoring was not good enough. More to that, KCTV station renewed her contract several times and her performance did not go well as positive. Nevertheless, U.S. District judge, <strong>John Lungstrum </strong>found evidence where KCTV station was looking for a young anchor in the position of Fuller.</p><p>At the end of the day, the court heard Karen's lawsuit because of the sufficient source of evidence. Although the settlement of the terms was highly confidential, both parties agreed to settle down and agreed not to talk about the settlement publicly.</p><h2>How Much Salary Does Karen Fuller Earn in 2021? Let's Explore Her Net Worth!</h2><p>Two-times Emmy Award-winning news anchor, Karen started her journalism career as an intern at <i>WHO-TV</i> in Des Moines after graduating from Drake University. Later, she joined the KIMT-TV station in Mason City as a morning and midday anchor. Furthermore, she worked with the KCTV station news team for almost 12 years. However, <i>Kansas City TV </i>terminated her without reason, which made her compelled to leave the station in <i>February 2015</i>.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Get to know about journalist</strong></i><strong> </strong><a href=#><strong>Sylvia Chase</strong></a></p><p>Fuller now broadcasts a news program alongside her fellow news anchor, <strong>Scott Sanborn </strong>on <i>CBS 2 </i>and <i>FOX 8 </i>in Cedar Rapids since <i>September 2015</i>. According to the channel's news director, <strong>Becky Lutgen Gardner</strong>, she became an essential addition to the newscast. In response, Karen mentioned she became impressed by the caliber of talent of <i>CBS 2 </i>and <i>FOX 8 </i>at KGAN-TV based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/6/6/iowa%20(1)-1622965028652.jpg><p>Karen is earning a decent earning from her notable works as a news anchor. On a similar side, a WGAN-TV news anchor garners an average salary of <strong>$53,495 </strong>annually. So, it might be comparable to Fuller's per annum income.
