He was raised in the Illinois town of Naperville. Sean&nbsp; was a quarterback for Naperville Central High School during his high school years. He went on to Eastern Illinois University, where he continued to play. In 1987 and 1988, Payton tried out for the NFL but was never selected. He began his coaching career as an offensive assistant at San Diego State University. Payton has coached in the NFL and at the university level. From 2003 through 2005, he served as the Dallas Cowboys’ quarterback coach. Since 2006, Payton has served as the Saints’ head coach. On March 21, 2012, Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 NFL season for his involvement in the New Orleans Saints bounty scandal. Money was provided to players who inflicted injuries on opponents’ players, causing them to miss games.</p><p>Payton was married until 2012 to Beth Shuey. They are the parents of two kids. Meghan, born in 1996, and Connor, born in 1999, are their children.</p><h2>Biographical Information</h2><p>Sean Payton was born in San Mateo, California on December 29, 1963. He’s 56 years old right now. Payton was born to Thomas and Jeanne Payton. He lived in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania during his elementary and middle school years (1970 to 1978). Sean began his senior year as a quarterback at Naperville Central High School in Naperville, Illinois, and graduated in 1982.</p><p>Payton obtained a football scholarship and went on to have a successful career as a quarterback at Eastern Illinois University, where he led the Panthers to an 11–2 record to the quarterfinals of the Division I-AA Playoffs in 1986. He also joined the Sigma Chi Fraternity while at EIU.</p><h2>Height and Weight</h2><p>Sean Payton has maintained an excellent physical condition. He is 5’11” tall and weighs roughly 91 kg. The rest of his body stats aren’t known. His eyes, on the other hand, are a combination of brown and hazel.</p><h2>Career and Professional Life</h2><p>Sean Payton began his coaching career at San Diego University in 1988 as a hostile coworker. He took different minor school instructing posts for diverse groups after leaving his position at the institution. In 1997, he was elevated to the Philadelphia Eagles’ quarterback coach position. He retired the next year and went on to coach the New York Giants’ quarterbacks in 1999. Payton became the Mammoths’ hostile facilitator the following year, leading them to Super Bowl XXXV glory.</p><p>Payton was hired as head coach of the New Orleans Saints in 2006. The squad had been suffering, hardly winning games, but with Payton’s arrival, they were able to reclaim their glory days and start winning again (after a poor first season). With his great teaching ability, he affected the club and guided the Saints to their first playoff appearance in six years.</p><p>They had great execution and one of the best details in the group, ranking fifth in scored focuses and first in passing. Payton’s team continued to win big games. He was named NFL Coach of the Year by the Associated Press in 2007. With a 10-6 record, he also assisted the New Orleans Saints in winning the NFC South. In Super Bowl XLIV in 2000, Payton led the club to a 31-17 win over the Indianapolis Colts.</p><p>Home Team: Coaching the Saints and Bringing New Orleans Back to Life was published by Sean Payton in 2010. The novel, which debuted at No. 8 on the New York Times Bestseller list, was co-written by Ellis Henican. Payton tore his MCL and broke his tibia in a collision with tight end Jimmy Graham’s helmet when Graham was tackled on the sideline on October 16, 2011, while coaching against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p><h3>More…..</h3>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener nofollow">A post shared by Sean.payton.TCS (@sean._.payton)</a></p><p>Between 2009 and 2011, the Saints’ coaching staff ran a bounty program that gave financial prizes to New Orleans defensive players who hurt opponents, according to the NFL. As punishment for their roles in the program, they suspended Payton for the entire 2012 NFL season. They also placed former defensive coordinator Gregg Williams (who joined the Rams earlier in the 2012 offseason) on indefinite suspension and general manager Mickey Loomis on an eight-game suspension.</p><p>The team was fined $500,000 and two second-round draft picks were taken away in addition to the unusual personnel sanctions. The Saints finished 7–9 in 2012 after that rocky off-season, but rebounded the next year after Payton returned to the sidelines, winning 11 games and earning a playoff berth. The Saints’ defense degenerated into one of the league’s worst after continuing to field one of the league’s greatest offenses for the next two years. New Orleans suffered three straight 7–9 seasons from 2014 to 2016.</p><h2>Status of the&nbsp; Relationship</h2><p>Sean Payton and Beth Shuey have two children: Meghan and Connor. Payton’s Play It Forward Foundation was founded by them as a non-profit organization. In the fields of well-being, education, and social welfare, the foundation works to better the lives of families and children. They also host the Black and Gold Gala once a year, which has drawn high-profile celebrities like Brad Pitt, Dr. Phil, and others.</p><p>In June 2012, Beth filed for legal separation from her husband, citing their diametrically opposed personalities as the reason. The divorce was finalized in 2014. Payton was in charge of child care while Beth was in charge of caring for the kids. Beth allegedly angered Payton before to filing for legal separation, according to rumors. Beth, on the other hand, never mentioned it in the press or in court as a basis for the divorce. Her children and she are currently living in Texas. Payton, on the other hand, visits the kids on occasion.</p><h2>Facts of Sean Payton</h2><table class="table table-striped facts"><tbody><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Full Name:</span></th><td>Patrick Payton</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Born Date:</span></th><td>29 Dec 1963</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Age:</span></th><td>57 years</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Horoscope:</span></th><td>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Lucky Number:</span></th><td>6</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Lucky Stone:</span></th><td>Topaz</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Lucky Color:</span></th><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Best Match for Marriage:</span></th><td>Scorpio, Virgo, Taurus</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Gender:</span></th><td>Male</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Profession:</span></th><td>Football coach</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Country:</span></th><td>USA</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Height:</span></th><td>5 feet 11 inches</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Marital Status:</span></th><td>divorce</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Divorce</span></th><td>Beth Shuey</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Net Worth</span></th><td>$22 million</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Salary</span></th><td>$8 million</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Eye Color</span></th><td>Hazel</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Hair Color</span></th><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Birth Place</span></th><td>San Mateo, California</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Nationality</span></th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Education</span></th><td>Naperville Central High School</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Father</span></th><td>Thomas</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Mother</span></th><td>Jeanne Payton</td></tr><tr><th><span style=font-weight:400>Kids</span></th><td>two (daughter: Meghan and son: Connor)</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaKuVlrtuvMCyq6imXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./celebrities-rocking-tight-pvc-looks-see-pics-hollywood-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celebrities Rocking Tight PVC Looks See Pics  Hollywood Life">&larr;
