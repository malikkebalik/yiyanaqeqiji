And it seems the discussion has again revived today following the release of her new book, The Twat Files, in 2023. However, she has not commented on her recent appearance.</strong></p><p><strong>Dawn Roma French</strong> is a British <strong><a href=#>actress</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>comedian</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>presenter</a></strong>, and writer best known for co-creating and starring in the BBC comedy sketch show, French and Saunders with her best friend and comedy partner, <strong>Jennifer Saunders</strong>. She also played Geraldine Granger in the BBC sitcom, The Vicar of Dibley.</p><p>Recently, Dawn French fans have noticed that she has gained weight drastically. As a result, they want to know the reason behind her weight gain. So, if you're seeking the same answer, we are here to help.</p><p>Have a look at the&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>weight gain</a></strong> stories of <strong><a href=#>Dawn French</a></strong>&nbsp;and <a href=#><strong>Raymond Felton</strong></a>.</p><h2>Dawn French’s Latest Weight Gain Appearance Has Surprised Many People!</h2><p><strong>Dawn French</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@dawnrfrench</a>) is recently in the spotlight after her appearance on The Graham Norton Show. Since the news, people were too quick to notice her body transformation. Although she has never openly discussed her current weight gain in public till now (today), the public believes she seems completely different.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/10/dawn-french-weight-gain-2023.jpg alt="Dawn French before and after weight gain. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Dawn French before and after weight gain.&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Image Source: HOUSE & WHIPS</strong></p><p>As we know, Dawn has previously spoken up about her weight gain and claimed that she doesn't give a f**k" about the number on the scales. The comedy actress claimed that she is now back to being an entire barrel, but she is unconcerned because she is still able to go about her regular routine. At the time, she <a href=# rel=noopener>shared</a>,</p><p><strong>I've gone back to being an entire barrel but do you know what, I'm going to be 63 this year, I don't give a f***, I really don't, so long as I can walk. I’m not going to be stingy to myself anymore. I never did dislike anything about my body, even when I was very, very fat. I refuse to be forced to dislike myself.</strong></p><p>She continued,</p><p><strong>I used to get really angry when I did lose weight, people going, 'You look so well,' as if you looked awful before - rewarding you for managing it, which is not easy, I accept that. But I didn't want people to give me approval. It's so patronising,” she added on her podcast French and Saunders: T**ting About.</strong></p><p>Previously, Dawn French started slimming down after her divorce from her comedian husband, <strong>Lenny Henry</strong>, in 2010, dropping seven and a half stone after learning she was at risk of uterine cancer. As a result of the health scare, she opted to have her womb removed in order to reduce the chances of cancer forming.</p><p>However, in order to execute the surgery effectively, doctors advised her that she would need to reduce her weight. Later, speaking at her 30 Million Minutes tour, she told the audience,</p><p><strong>When I was due to have my hysterectomy the doc told me that if I could lose some weight before the op, they would be able to do it via keyhole, and I would recover in three weeks or so. Otherwise it would be big open surgery, and three months to recover. So, I set about dropping a few stone.</strong></p><p>When asked how she dropped the weight, Dawn made it clear that there is no secret formula for losing weight. Instead of getting a gastric band or something similar, she chose to keep things as simple and healthy as possible.&nbsp;Once she reached her target weight, she continued to exercise more and eat less, but she was never too harsh with herself.</p><p>As a result, Dawn French still seems to be dealing with her weight gain struggles in 2023. Although she has yet not provided any details about her current transformation, we believe she is trying to live a healthy life. Well, we'll be back soon if we gain more information about her transformation.</p><h2>Dawn French Is Still Haunted by an Awful Mistake She Committed After Being Invited to a 007 Premiere!</h2><p><strong>Dawn French</strong> has spoken up about a humiliating email mistake that had her in tears. The comedian and writer appeared on The Graham Norton Show, to open up on the iconic red sofa about a mistake that still haunts her to this day when she mistakenly wrote an inappropriate and scathing email about a<strong> James Bond</strong> premiere event to the exact individuals who had invited her to attend. She <a href=# rel=noopener>recalled</a>,</p><p><strong>It was a big dealbut red carpets are not my thing. So, I thought it would be funny to send my PA a response that would make her laugh, and then she could send a polite ‘no’ on my behalf.</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/10/dawn-french-now.jpg alt="Dawn French recently appeared on The Graham Norton Show to promote her new book. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Dawn French recently appeared on The Graham Norton Show to promote her new book.&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Chortle</strong></p><p>She continued:</p><p><strong>I wrote, with lots of swearing, ‘This will be another wanky red carpet events be full of the usual twats and I would rather have my eyes pecked out by diseased pigeons and my breasts gnawed off by rabid wild dogs’.” You can see where this is going, can’t you?</strong></p><p>Dawn concluded:</p><p><strong>I was a bit surprised a couple of minutes later to get an email from the PR department that had sent the invite, saying, ‘Thank you for your speedy response – we totally understand’. Oh dear, I was so embarrassed!</strong></p><p>Dawn French joined the show to talk about her new book, The Twat Files, which she thinks will spark an anti-perfection league. The Vicar of Dibley actress explained:</p><p><strong>We carry a lot of shame, humiliation, and guilt about our mistakes, and I thought, ‘These mistakes are where I have learnt the most and where the fun is. So, if you can wrangle back some of that shame and shine a light on it, it dissipates. If you own your mistakes, it’s very empowering.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGibmq%2BeYrOzsc2cn2avlZ60qcCMoJiipl8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-does-he-weigh-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Does He Weigh Now?">&larr;
